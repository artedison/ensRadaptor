#ens

An MCMC based approach to paramterize ODE based models. It will use Monte Carlo sampling to sample the parameter space with respect to the experimental measurement. It is essentially nonlinear optimization and can give uncerntainty estimation by the sampling itself. The two main input files are ens.i01 and ens.i02, and it will produce multiple output files. More detals of ens method can be find [here](https://www.dropbox.com/work/Projects/Bioinformatics_modeling/ensemble_infor/doc).
